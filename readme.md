# Purpose and Scope of Application

The purpose of the application is to allow the user to select an item or multiple items of clothing, which will then output a total cost to the user once they have selected the items they have desired. 



Target Audience in regards to a solution to problems that the app would resolve would be for people who would want to buy the items of clothing desired, and for developers it would be as an example of a simple terminal application which uses object-oriented programming. For a customer the app will display the items of clothing, and prompt the user to  select which item of clothing they would like to buy (T-Shirts, Pants and Shoes). Once they have selected which item of clothing they would like to have, the user is then asked to input the amount of the selected item they have.  The app will allow the user to exit at any time, and then calculate their bill based on the items selected and the quantity.
